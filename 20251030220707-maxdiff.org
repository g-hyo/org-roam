#+title: maxdiff

MaxDiff in survey research is a technique for working out relative preference.

# Context

When asking people to provide rankings, people are likely to give poor data for the middle options

# Solution

Generally, the top and bottom choices will be reliable.

MaxDiff leverages this, and forces respondents to choose best and worst attributes from subsets of the original set.
