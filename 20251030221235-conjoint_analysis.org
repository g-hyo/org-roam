#+title: conjoint analysis

Conjoint analysis in survey research is a technique used to understand how different features of products are valued.

The assumption is that a product can be broken down into a set of attributes that impact the users perceived value

# Technique

Sources are relatively vague, but my understanding is that respondents are shown 'mock' products which are essentially combinations of levels of the constituent attributes.

Respondents are then asked to choose from, rank or rate the products shown.

Presumably, the data are then used in terms of their raw values
