#+title: rlang


rlang is a collection of frameworks and APIs for programming in R.

Usefully, rlang can be used to store R expressions such that they can be executed at a later point in time. This is useful when we would like to provide expressions as an argument into a function (i.e., if we are writing a function where we'll be running `dplyr` functions within).
