#+title: matrix multiplication

Matrix multiplication is defined as follows

Given two matrices A and B where A has dimensions m x n, and B has dimensions n x p, the product C = AB is a matrix C with dimensions m x p.

Each element $c_{ij}$ of C is computed as the sum of the product of the elements of the $i^{th}$ row of A, and the $j^{th}$ column of B.

Due to this definition, matrix multiplication is only defined when the number of columns in matrix A is equal to the number of rows in matrix B.
