#+title: Newton-Raphson method

The Newton-Raphson method, also known as Newton's method, is a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better approximations to the roots (zeroes) of a real-valued function.

* Formula

x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0)

Where:
- f is a real valued function
- f' is its derivative
- x0 is an initial guess for a root

x1 should be a better approximation of the root than x0
