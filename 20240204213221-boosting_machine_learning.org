#+title: boosting (machine learning)

Boosting in the context of machine learning, is an ensemble algorithm that converts weak learnings to strong ones. It is based on a question posed by Kearns and Valiant (1988, 1989):

 "Can a set of weak learners create a single strong learner?" A weak learner is defined to be a classifier that is only slightly correlated with the true classification (it can label examples better than random guessing). In contrast, a strong learner is a classifier that is arbitrarily well-correlated with the true classification.
