#+title: grep

* Equivalent

** Windows

Windows does not come with `grep` but instead has its own version, "findstr"

Usage of "findstr" is as follows:

```
findstr flags "text" file
findstr "hello" * # current directory
findstr "hello" *.md # .md files only
```


** git

Get has its own version of grep. To use it, you must be in a git repository. You can then search for text in the git repository with:

```
git grep 'text'
```

** emacs eshell

`grep` is implemented in the emacs eshell. Allowing you to use it under different operating systems and outside of a git repo. To run eshell's grep, use the following template:

```
grep text files/directory
grep 'text' . # To search current directory
grep -r 'text' . # recursively search current directory
grep -rw 'text' . # recursively search current directory for 'text' as a whole word
```
