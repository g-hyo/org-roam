#+title: CRUD

In computer programming, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are the four basic operations of persistent storage. CRUD can also be used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate interactions with data.

* SQL Example

In standard SQL, each aspect of CRUD can be mapped to a SQL statement

- Create - INSERT
- Read - SELECT
- Update - UPDATE
- Delete - DELETE

* RESTFUL APIs

Restful APIs also map each aspect of CRUD.

- Create - POST/PUT
- Read - GET
- Update - PUT to replace, PATCH to modify
- Delete - DELETE
