#+title: confusion matrix

A confusion matrix is a table layout that visualises the performance of a classification algorithm.

* Binary Case

In the case of binary classification, a confusion matrix is simply a table of actual vs predicted values

            Predicted
Observed   | Positive        | Negative        |
           | True Positives  | False Negatives |
           | False Positives | True Negatives  |

From this matrix, you can derive metrics such as sensitivity, specificity or the matthews correlation coefficient, which can be used to assess the accuracy of your classification algorithm.
