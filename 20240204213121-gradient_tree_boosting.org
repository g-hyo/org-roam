#+title: gradient tree boosting

Gradient tree boosting is a technique based on [[id:a6f42b13-198e-4f6b-aa2b-64227cd61207][boosting (machine learning)]]

Essentially, you start with a function `F` that predicts some value `y`. Gradient boosting occurs with M stages. At each stage m, the algorithm is improved by adding a new function/decision tree `h`

```
y = F(xi) + h(xi)
```

`h` will try to fit the residuals of `F`, thus attempting to correct the errors of its predecessor. `h` functions are added recursively until your model is satisfactory.
