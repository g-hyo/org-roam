#+title: matrix calculus

Matrix calculus is a specialized notation for doing multivariable calculus, especially over spaces of matrices.

* Scalar operation equivalents

** Division

Unlike scalars, division is not defined in linear algebra. As such, linear equations are solved with other techniques like using the [[id:dd8d26c8-f383-4f22-9904-f6130dcb4be0][inverse (matrix)]]


* Common Derivatives

Where $B$ is a matrix, and $b$ is a scalar

$f(x)$ -> $df/dx$
$x^TB$ -> $B$
$x^Tb$ -> $b$
$x^Tx$ -> $2x$
$x^TBx$ -> $2Bx$
