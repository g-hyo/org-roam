#+title: Rainbow Mode

Rainbow mode is a minor mode in [[id:1897a0ff-0869-480f-abc4-3845d175fdb2][Emacs]] which sets background color to strings that match color
names, e.g. #0000ff is displayed in white with a blue background.

** Usage

This is particularly helpful when using `list-colors-display` in emacs as you can quickly
preview a colour. This is particularly handy when using [[id:c1386212-358d-4c1e-9fde-f4f4b7639fd8][Customize]] to update your emacs faces so you can
see just how well a colour might work for your current theme.
