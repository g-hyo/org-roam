* Treesitter

Treesitter is an alternative method of conducting syntax highlighting. Compared to Emacs 'font-lock' method, which is the default, treesitter is meant to provide superior language specific highlighting.

* Getting started

Once treesitter is installed, you can enable it for a specific buffer by running `tree-sitter-hl-mode`. This will replace highlighting provided with `font-lock-mode` with tree-based syntax highlighting.

* Setting treesitter as default

In order to set `treesitter` as the default highlighting package for a particular major mode (i.e., ess or Python), you will have to add a [[id:3db5b4af-f38e-455a-9934-48fb6e9ee747][emacs hook]] containing `tree-sitter-hl-mode` to your specific major mode hook. For example:

#+
(add-hook 'rust-mode-hook 'tree-sitter-hl-mode)
#+
