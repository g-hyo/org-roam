#+title: hypertext

Hypertext is text with references (hyperlinks) to other text.

     "'Hypertext' is a recent coinage. 'Hyper-' is used in the mathematical sense of extension and generality (as in 'hyperspace,' 'hypercube') rather than the medical sense of 'excessive' ('hyperactivity')... 'Hyper-' refers to structure and not size."
    — Theodor H. Nelson, Brief Words on the Hypertext, 23 January 1967
