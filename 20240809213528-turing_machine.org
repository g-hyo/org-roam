#+title: turing machine

A Turing Machine is a hypothetical machine thought up by Alan Turing. Despite its simplicity, the machine can simulate any computer algorithm.

* Structure

The Turing machine consists of an infinitely-long tape containing squares. Each square on the tape can contain the symbols 0, 1 and "" (blank). Such a machine would be called a 3-symbol Turing machine.

At any time, the machine can have its head positioned over a square on the tape and perform some basic operations:
- read the symbol
- edit the symbol
- move the tape left or right by one square
- nothing

* Machine State

The turing machine has a state, which can be used to define the operation to action. This is how the machine terminates.
