# K Nearest Neighbours

K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) is a method of supervised learning algorithm.

It uses observations in the training set $\tau$ closest in the input space to $x$ to form $\hat{Y}$

Mathematically, it is defined as follows:
\[
\hat{Y}(x) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{x_{i} \epsilon N_{k}(x)}y_i
\]

Where:

$\hat{Y}(x)$ represents the predicted value of target Y for a given input x

$N_{k}(x)$ represents the set of K nearest neighbours of input x in the training dataset

$x_{i}$ represents each neighbour in the set $N_{k}(x)$
$y_{i}$ represents the target value for each neighbour $x_{i}$

Essentially, the average of the outputs for the set of neighbour inputs is used to generate a prediction for the input $x$

* Properties

- Error on the training data is an increasing function of k, and will be 0 for k = 1
- The effective number of parameters of KNN is N/k
- You cannot use sum of squared errors on training, as this will always pick k = 1
