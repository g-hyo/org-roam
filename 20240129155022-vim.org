Vim is a popular text editor.

Famously, its `normal` mode for editing allows one to do quick text exits with keyboard shortcuts.

For example:
- `ysiw(` (yank surround inside word) will add `()` around a word under the cursor
- `5G` will go to line 5
- `dd` will delete the line
- "ma" will set a mark at the line under the cursor, "`a" will bring the cursor back to the mark. "a" can be replaced with any letter here to keep track of multiple marks.
- Ctrl+F - Move forward one screenful. +B to move backward.
- { - to move to start of previous paragraph. } to move to end of next paragraph
- * - to select the word under the cursor
- Ctrl + [ - Is usually set up as an alternative to get to normal mode.
