#+title: shebang

A shebang is a character sequence consisting of `#!` placed at the beginning of a script.

In unix systems, it defines how to interpret the file.

* Examples
`#!/bin/sh` - Execute using the shell
`#!/bin/bash` - Execute using bash shell
`#!/usr/bin/env python3` - Execute with Python, using the `env` program search path to find it.

* Windows
Windows does not actually support shebangs but `gitbash` seems to work with them
