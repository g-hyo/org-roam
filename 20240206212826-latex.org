LaTex is a software system for typesetting documents. It is widely used in academia and the publication of scientific documents.

* Math Mode

One of the key advantages of LaTex is the ability to enter math. There are three methods of declaring math mode

1. Inline
   $...$

2. Equations with label
    \begin{equation}
    \end{equation}

    Note this doesnt work in org mode

3. Equations with no label
   \[...\]

** Cheat sheet

Some common expressions in math mode

\beta = $\beta$
\hat{x} = $\hat{x}$
\sum_{i=0}^k X_{i} = $\sum_{i=0}^k X_{i}$
