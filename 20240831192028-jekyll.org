Jekyll is a static website generator written in Ruby

* Usage

The two main commands you will be using to modify the site will be

 * `jekyll build` - Builds static site to `_site` directory.
 * `jekyll serve` - build and runs on local web server. You can use `--livereload` to refresh the site with every change.

* Themes

To install themes for `jekyll`, you will want to modify your `jekyll` `Gemfile` to specify the `gem` to be used, and then you will want to run the following to install the gem as well as required dependencies:
