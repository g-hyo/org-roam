#+title: windows search bar

The windows search bar annoyingly sometimes hangs (i.e., when you click on search, it never shows anything).

If this happens to you, you can simply run task manager, and click `end task` on windows explorer. Your task bar will then disappear.

After this, click File > run new task, and type in `explorer.exe`.

The search bar should work again
